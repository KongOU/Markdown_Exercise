# Lesson 1 Italics and Bold

## Italics

> To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, \_this_ word would become italic.

Make the word "not" italic.

Writing in Markdown is _not_ that hard!

## Bold

> Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will `**really\*\*` get your point across.

I **will** complete these lessons!

## Italic and Bold

> Of course, you can use \_both italics and bold\_ in the same line. You can also span them `**across multiple words**`.

"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

## For the final exercise in this lesson, we're going to make some words bold and italic.

> In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores. In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic.

If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

# Lessong 2 Header

> Let's take a look at another formatting convention: the header. Headers are frequently used on websites, magazine articles, and notices, to draw attention to a section. As their name implies, they act like titles or subtitles above sections.

To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.

`# Header one`

`## Header two`

`### Header three`

`#### Header four`

`##### Header five`

`###### Header six`

# Header one

## Header two

### Header three

#### Header four

##### Header five

###### Header six

# Lesson 3

> There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: \[Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

\[Search for it.](www.google.com)

[Search for it.](www.google.com)

[**really, really**](www.dailykitten.com)

Here's [a link to something else][another place].
Here's [yet another link][another-link].
And now back to [the first link][another place].

[another place]: www.github.com
[another-link]: www.google.com
